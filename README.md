# HerokuISS
This is a practice Python app that I turned into a web app with Dash, Flask, and Heroku.
It displays an unlabeled map with the current position of the International Space Station (ISS). 
To see if the ISS' position has changed just reload the site.

Over time, I hope to improve this app with better styling, and have it update the ISS position automatically without a reload.

The basic logic for finding the ISS came from the [YouTube channel Python Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/c/FlickThrough/) 
by Giles McMullen-Klein. You can find the [original tutorial video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CCTuHast0).

If you're using Heroku this app will work automatically (or at least it should). Just clone this repo, create your Heroku app from the terminal, and push!
